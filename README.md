# Ye Olde Pub Name Generator

A webpage suggesting names for pubs, available
[here](https://jdw1996.github.io/pub-name-generator). This is my first project
using the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) language, here transpiled to
JavaScript.

You can build the JavaScript by executing `build.sh` from the root of the
repository. It requires that `dart2js` is runnable from your terminal.

If you have any pointers you'd like to share about my code, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/jdw1996/pub-name-generator/issues/new) or
email me at [jdwinters96@gmail.com](mailto:jdwinters96@gmail.com).
